# The Gallery

A digital exhibition of interactive web art, exploring themes of hidden emotion and mundane consequences. This project relies on vanilla JavaScript, the HTML5 Canvas API, and Three.js to create robust, highly optimized, and aesthetically interactive experiences.

## 🏛️ Exhibits

### 1. The Shadow (`js/components/Mirror.js`)
**_"Your secrets are safe with me."_**

This work invites the user to type their secrets into the void. As they type, the text vanishes, and the characters are transformed into tears that fall from the face of a silhouetted figure.

#### Underlying Functions:
*   **Canvas Compositing**: The shadow figure is rendered using the 2D Canvas API. A complex clipping mask (`ctx.clip()`) ensures the figure is "contained" within the frame while hiding the body below the dialog box.
*   **Particle System (`update()`, `spawnTear()`)**: Each keystroke spawns a particle object. These particles obey custom physics:
    *   **Face Physics**: Particles trickle down the face using a `Wobble` sine-wave function to simulate liquid surface tension.
    *   **Air Physics**: Once they leave the chin, gravity increases, and they drift naturally.
*   **Input Masking (`handleInput()`)**: The HTML input is transparent (`opacity: 0`). A custom "Ghost Cursor" and "Vanishing Text" system renders the characters momentarily before fading them out, creating the illusion of typing into nothingness.
*   **Audio Synthesis**: Integrated with `AudioManager`, every keystroke triggers a note from a pre-defined melody (Fur Elise), creating a melancholic soundtrack that evolves with the user's interaction.

### 2. The Button (`js/components/RubberButton.js`)
**_"Your actions have no consequences."_**

an interactive "Do Not Touch" pedestal featuring a highly reactive, soft-body red button. The button feels sticky, heavy, and alive, rewarding the user's disobedience with a confetti explosion.

#### Underlying Functions:
*   **Three.js & WebGL**: The scene is rendered using a custom Three.js setup with high-quality PBR materials for the rubber and metal textures.
*   **Soft Body Physics (`updateDeformation()`)**: The button is not a static mesh. It uses a vertex displacement algorithm:
    *   **Cauchy Distribution**: When clicked/dragged, vertices are weighted based on their distance from the cursor.
    *   **Necking & Bulging**: As the button is stretched, the code simulates Poisson's ratio—thinning the "strand" (`necking`) and preserving volume by expanding the base (`bulging`).
    *   **Sticky Hand**: The button "sticks" to the cursor until a `snapLimit` is reached.
*   **Heartbeat System**: The button has a dormant state where it pulses rhythmically (`updateHeartbeat()`), modifying the mesh scale and position to simulate breathing or a heartbeat.
*   **Confetti Physics (`updateConfetti()`)**: Upon snapping, a custom particle system detonates.
    *   **Paper Physics**: Particles uses a specialized aerodynamic model that calculates `Drag`, `Flutter` (sine-wave drift), and `Tilt` to simulate light paper falling through air, rather than simple cannonballs.

## 🛠️ Core Utilities

### Audio Manager (`js/utils/AudioManager.js`)
A centralized audio engine using the Web Audio API. It avoids external mp3 assets in favor of real-time synthesis for faster load times and dynamic response.

*   **Oscillator Banks**: Sounds are created using `OscillatorNode` (Sine, Triangle, Square).
*   **Ethereal Echo**: A custom delay/feedback loop (`createDelay`, `createGain`) creates a heavy, atmospheric reverb characteristic of the gallery's mood.
*   **Vocal Synthesis**: The "Sad Sigh" sound is procedurally generated by layering three detuned sine waves to simulate a choral/ghostly human voice (`playSadSigh`).
*   **Sequencer**: Manages the playback of the "Fur Elise" melody, handling Rondo form sequencing and note advancement.

## 📂 Project Structure
*   `index.html`: Main entry point and layout definition.
*   `styles.css`: Responsive design, CSS variables for frame scaling (`--frame-width`), and vintage aesthetics.
*   `js/main.js`: Bootstrapper that initializes the components.
*   `js/config.js`: Centralized configuration file for tuning physics constants (Gravity, Drag, Colors) and audio settings.
